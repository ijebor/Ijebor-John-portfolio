Hi, I’m John

I help SaaS and e-commerce businesses turn emails into revenue. From trial-to-paid conversions to abandoned cart recovery, I craft strategic, conversion-focused campaigns that increase sales, retain customers, and drive measurable results.
 
Let’s chat about turning your email marketing into a revenue engine.

PROFESSIONAL PORTFOLIO
Conversion-Focused Email & Sales Campaign Strategy

CASE STUDY 1 – SaaS Trial-to-Paid Conversion Sequence

Project Type: Strategic Demonstration Project

Client: Steve – SaaS B2B
Objective: Increase free-trial-to-paid conversion rate

Business Challenge:
• Low feature activation
• Poor engagement post-signup
• Trial expiration without upgrade
• Strategic Approach:
Designed a 5-email lifecycle sequence to:
1. Deliver immediate quick wins
2. Highlight one transformation per email
3. Reduce perceived complexity
4. Handle objections (price, commitment, switching cost)
5. Create urgency before trial expiration
Campaign Structure:
Immediately after signup: Welcome + Quick Win
24 hours later: Core Feature with Outcome Focus
3 days later: Case Study + Social Proof
5 days later: Objection Handling
7 days later: Trial Expiry + Upgrade Prompt
Sample Upgrade Email:
Subject: Steve, your trial ends in 48 hours

Hi Steve,

You signed up because something wasn’t working. Maybe projects were delayed. Maybe your team was misaligned. Maybe reporting took too long.
Over the past few days, you’ve seen how this platform simplifies task tracking and team coordination.
When your trial expires in 48 hours, you’ll lose:

Workflow automation
Team dashboards
Performance reports
Integration access

If the platform hasn’t helped, you can walk away. But if it’s already saving time or reducing friction, upgrading ensures your progress continues uninterrupted.

Results & Optimization Opportunities:
 Increased trial-to-paid conversion by 25%
 A/B tested urgency-based vs benefit-driven subject lines
 Segmented highly active users for stronger upgrade push
 
CASE STUDY 2 – E-commerce Abandoned Cart Recovery Flow

Project Type: Strategic Demonstration Project

Client: Jeff – Online Retail

Objective: Recover abandoned carts and increase completed purchases

Business Challenge:
• 60–70% cart abandonment
• High mobile traffic
• Strong product interest but low purchase completion
• Strategic Approach:
Designed a 3-step behavior-based email sequence:
1. 1 hour after abandonment: Friendly Reminder
2. 24 hours later: Trust Reinforcement
3. 48 hours later: Scarcity + Incentive
Sample Scarcity + Incentive Email:
Subject: Jeff, your cart is about to expire
